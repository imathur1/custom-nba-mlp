# custom-nba-mlp

A custom [MLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) model built without sklearn, pytorch, or tensorflow. The purpose of this project
was to familiarize myself with the underlying math and logic behind simple neural networks. The model predicts, with 83% accuracy, the likelihood that a
college basketball player will be drafted into the NBA. The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adityak2003/college-basketball-players-20092021).
